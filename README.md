# Corn Classification Project

## Description

The Corn Classification Project is a machine learning solution designed to classify different types of corn using image data. The project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, and is powered by PyTorch for training and evaluation of models. This project highlights my expertise in computer vision, model optimization, and data science workflows.
## Features

- Image Classification: Predicts the type of corn from image data.

- Model Training and Fine-Tuning: Includes Jupyter notebooks for training and improving models.

- Pretrained Models: Utilizes and fine-tunes pretrained models for higher accuracy.

- Visualizations: Displays model performance using visual graphs (e.g., model.png).

- Model Checkpointing: Saves and reuses trained models for predictions (e.g., model-0.pth).

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+

- PyTorch

- Jupyter Notebook
